# Office-C2R-Deployment


This tool will create a GPO, pushing a shortcut out to user desktops, allowing them to uninstall the old Office copy, and install the new Office copy without needing local administrator rights.

As credentials for a domain admin service account are stored encrypted on an accessible server share, with the key hidden but available, this is not suitable for commercial use.
